	<p> Crannog: a poem by Moya Cannon </p>
	<p> 
		Where an ash bush grows in the lake
		a ring of stones has broken cover
		in this summer's drought.
		Not high enough to be an <span id = "island">_________</span>,
		it holds a disc of stiller water
		in the riffled lake. 
	</p>
	<p> Trees have reclaimed the railway line behind us;
		behind that, the road goes east-
		as two lines parallel in <span id = "space">_________</span> and time run away from us
		this discovered circle draws us in.
		In drowned towns
		bells toll only for sailors and for the credulous
		but this necklace of wet stones,
		remnant of a wattle Atlantis,
		catches us all by the throat.
	</p>
	<p>
		We don't know what beads or blades
		are held in the bog lake's wet amber
		but much of us longs to live in water
		and we recognise this surfacing
		of old <span id = "homes">_________</span> of love and hurt.
	</p>
	<p>
		A troubled bit of us is kin
		to people who drew a <span id = "circle">_________</span> in water,
		loaded boats with stone,
		and raised a dry island and a fort
		with a whole lake for a moat.
	</p>
