<h1>Assignment 2.2 - Building a Web Page Exercise, Part 2</h1>
<h2>Chapter 1: Introduction</h2>
<p class="intro">I was born in the Offutt Air Force Base hospital located near Bellevue Nebraska.
My parents did not have any other children.
My father was an active member of the Air Force at the time.
My mother was a preschool teacher at a local Montessori School.</p>
<p>I grew up in Bellevue Nebraska and lived there for most of my life.
We would visit my father's family in Michigan and my mother's family in Ireland.
Other than trips to visit family, we did not visit many other places.</p>
<p>I attended the Motessori school where my mother taught from 18 months old through 2nd grade.
<span class="sentence">The school and class sizes were very small.</span>
I ended up being very close to my classmates during my time at the school.
I am still friends with some of them eventhough we are spread out across the country now.
</p>
<p>After 2nd grade, my father wanted me to attend public school.
I attended the closest elementary school for 3rd grade.
We moved and I had to change schools for 4th through 6th grade.
